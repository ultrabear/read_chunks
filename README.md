# `read_chunks`
This crate provides an extension to types implementing `Read` that allows them to read data in large chunks until the end of the file, similar to how `slice::chunks` works.

# Licensing
This crate is dual licensed as `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, this is to allow it to be compatible with the license of the rust standard library.
